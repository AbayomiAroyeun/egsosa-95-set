Dear EGSOSA '95 Family,<br><br>
It is with great pride and joy that I welcome you all to this special platform 
that connects us beyond the walls of Ebenezer Grammar School. 
The memories we created together have become the foundation for 
lifelong friendships, personal growth, and our collective success stories.
This reunion isn't just a celebration of our past, but a rekindling
of our commitment to one another and to the legacy of our great school.
Let us use this opportunity to support one another, invest in our alma mater, 
and inspire the next generation.
Long live EGSOSA '95! Long live Ebenezer Grammar School!<br><br>
